# Trichoplax_Thermotaxis

Data and code:

Experiment_List.xlsx -- List of all experiments

Temperature_files [folder] -- IR camera images or thermistor readouts for all trials for which we have the temperature data

Txt files with numbered names -- Centroid trajectory for each segmented trial from Experiment_List.xlsx with file name corresponding to trial number

Data_analysis.ipynb -- Main data analysis file, used to generate most figures. Here, one can also find plots and analysis approaches that didn't make it into the paper. 

Naringenin Data Processing-2.ipynb -- data analysis file for naringenin data (Fig 5 in main text)

Switch experiment.ipynb -- data analysis file for the temperature gradient switch experiment 

Levy_Exponential_Trajectory_Length.m -- MATLAB script for trying LÃ©vy and exponential fits for the step length data

MSD_AND_PERSISTENCE.m -- MATLAB script for analyzing MSD and persistence lengths 

Overlaid_Traj_colored_by_time.m -- MATLAB script for visualizing trajectories 

RMSD_last_x_points.m  -- MATLAB script for analyzing RMSD

Sample Raw data [folder] -- one sample raw image folder each for thermal gradient and control conditions, along with MATLAB script for segmenting the organisms, and sample outputs (text file with centroid trajectory and trajectory visualizations folder) -- see Readme inside this subfolder. Because it's slow and painful to commit large files to Github (we had to break 2 raw image folders into around 5 commits), we are trying to explore Google Cloud and other options and will update. 

--------
Results and places where file/figure outputs from code are found:

Reciprocal BLAST results [folder] -- Folder with our Reciprocol BLAST results , as well as reference papers 

PaperFigs [folder] -- Figures in the paper, generated by the various files

RMSD Results - Where the outputs of the MATLAB script, RMSD_last_x_points.m, go

BeadExperiment_Angles.xlsx -- Excel sheet with angles calculated from bead experiment image frames 

Neurokit_results_V_many_window_sizes.xlsx -- Excel sheet with neurokit results for various window lenghts, non-overlapping windows 

Neurokit_results_V_Overlap_Many_Window_Sizes.xlsx -- Excel sheet with neurokit results for various window lenghts, overlapping windows 

Misc Plots - Trajectories that were visualized but weren't included in the paper

Taylor RMSD combined.xlsx -- Combined results for different experiment conditions, generated by above script.
